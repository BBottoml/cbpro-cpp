Explanation: In this example we place two trades and output their generated ids provided by the exchange. The first is a market buy order where we want to purchase BTC (base currency) using USD (quote currency). When placing a market order we have to specify at least one of size or funds. In this example, we use funds and state that we want to purchase 150 USD worth of BTC. The second trade we place is more complicated. First, we construct an "options" object (note: this is one of the only objects you have to construct in this library and is not necessary to use) which allows us to set more granular parameters about the order. Instead of placing a market order, we are placing a limit order. In this order, we wish to purchase 0.01 BTC at a maximum price of 40000 USD per 1 BTC. Additionally, we set two options. The first is time in force with a value of good till time (GTT). The second specifies how long to wait before cancelling the order. In other words, we wish to purchase the aforementioned size at the given price but if the order is not filled in one minute, cancel it. 

Lastly, see the 4th argument for the Auth object. This argument takes an enum value of Auth::Mode which can either be SANDBOX or LIVE. SANDBOX refers to trading on the Coinbase Pro Sandbox exchange whereas LIVE refers to actual live trading (proceed with caution if live trading).
